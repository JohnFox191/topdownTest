Only a very basic showcase of the controller and style of the prototype I'm working on, the rest of the stuff I've done can't really be glued together right now into a single scene.

To run you must have either use one of the exports in the 'exports' folder, godot to open the project or python 3.+ in conjunction with a browser. 

With python , open a terminal on 'exports/html' folder:

-Insert the command "python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1"

-Open "127.0.0.1:8000" on your browser and run the .html file, the game should load up

Controls: Arrow keys and mouse to aim and shoot

Made with godot engine.
